 # ðŸŽ“ Diploma Project: Interactive Educational Robot with Mobile App Control  
**Author:** Mihaela Dilyanova Mihaylova  
**Field:** Embedded Systems  

--- INTRODUCTION ----
-
An innovative **robot** designed to make learning fun and engaging. It provides an easy and interactive way to encourage even the youngest learners to explore new concepts while enjoying the process. Why not combine something useful with something entertaining? Education is an essential part of our daily lives, constantly unveiling new horizons that advance at a rapid pace.

That is why "ROBO" is something newâ€”unconventional, different, exciting, and interactiveâ€”a combination of logic, vision, and effort that can turn into a passion or even a hobby.

Embedded systems are an integral part of our daily routines, pushing us to improve ourselves and showcase our best, proving that everything is in our hands.

"ROBO" will teach us to be better, to explore technology, and to stay in tune with the times, keeping up with everyone else.
